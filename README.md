# Digital-Preservation-Headaches
Many challenges may arise in the field of digital preservation. The Open Preservation Foundation's Archives Interest Group (OPF AIG) is taking stock of the most important headaches faced by the digital preservation community. This form aims to identify the main challenges you face.

Examples of headaches you may face may be related to tooling or preservation policies. We invite all types of headaches related to digital preservation, so please do feel free to be creative. For submitting more than one headache, please fill out this form several times.

The purpose of anonymously collecting your main headaches in the field of digital preservation is twofold. First of all, we are seeking to share knowledge from the community on these issues. Others may have faced similar problems, and may already have found suitable solutions. Secondly, we are aiming to identify issues which could be addressed through organising working groups.

Under 'issues', you can see which headaches were already submitted. We invite you to respond to headaches for which you have a cure! After all, digital preservation is something you should not do in solitude, but together.
